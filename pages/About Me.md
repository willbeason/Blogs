Hi, I'm **Will Beason**.
I'm a 24 year-old gay Google software developer in the Bay Area.
I'm that guy on the right with the crooked glasses and the hair that would have been combed if I'd been warned about the photo-op sooner than 5 minutes before.

A long time ago the completely different person who happened to inhabit my body in 2010 went to [The United States Military Academy at West Point](http://www.usma.edu/SitePages/Home.aspx) for a couple years before figuring out the whole military thing wasn't my thing.
While there, I submitted a science fiction short story to [Writers of the Future](http://www.writersofthefuture.com/) and won an honorable mention.
After leaving, my professors got me a speaking engagement at the 2012 Sunbelt conference for the [International Network for Social Network Analysis](http://www.insna.org/).
(I wrote a bot that spammed Google and made a pretty network graph of Congress.)

I transferred to the [University of Texas](http://www.utexas.edu/) and continued my studies in math and physics. In the summer of 2013 I volunteered as a biostatistician for [Wilford Hall Ambulatory Surgical Center](http://www.whasc.af.mil/).
While in San Antonio I met my boyfriend, Richard Knight.
He does robots and coffee and food (and physics!).
My last semester at UT I taught a class in [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/), the typesetting system for people who like having to write a program every time they want to type a paragraph.

In May 2014 I graduated with Bachelors of Science in Physics and Mathematics and went straight to work for [IBM Watson](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/).
In mid 2015 I joined [Google Research](https://research.google.com/) as a software developer working on using natural language processing understand the web.
In my spare time I read, write, make art with math, and write experimental programs that won't take over the world. (I promise.)

If you want to know more, stay tuned.
