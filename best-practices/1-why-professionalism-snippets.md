# Why Professionalism?

It is possible to develop good software that does interesting things.

It seems endemic, the idea that software must either be interesting or be well designed.
I'm having trouble fathoming why.
The best way to increase a project's odds of success are to follow this nebulous, ever-changing set of "best practices".
The best developers alive have written (at great length) how many a project was saved by slowing down and thinking before proceeding.
Very few projects succeed on novelty alone.

Many research projects fail.
We can improve the odds; they are not written in stone.
Not only that, but we already know how.
As a profession we've built up a sizeable collection of knowledge, so why are so few willing to tap into it?
Are other professions so willing to wallow in unnecessary uncertainty?
How can we expect to do anything new without understanding the wisdom of those who came before us?

It's right there.
Like *right there*.  
The grand pattern of all civilization.
It is built into our every problem.
**Build on what others discovered.**
You will stand all the taller if only you climb on the shoulders of giants.
Why accept anything less?

What does this mean?
Don't do something someone else (or you) has already done.
Don't make mistakes that anyone else has told you about.

More concretely: We already know that requirements, design, and planning are major factors in a project's success.
There can be no excuse for not doing these things.
If you consider yourself a software professional, I dare you to plead ignorance.

*Clean Coder* influenced me so much.
Every day I strive to learn, to become better, to live up to the standards in that book.

It's disconcerting to hear things like
  -	 "Let's not waste time refactoring."
  -	 "I spent weeks in this prototype code, so I'm just going to check it in rather than write it again."
  -	 "We can't plan because there's no way to know how long this will take."
  -	 "We can't focus on quality because someone else might do something exciting in the meantime."
*Are you serious?*

This is one of those cases where the adherence to anti-professionalism is almost religious.
I'm doubtful reason will get many to come around.
Rather, like antivaxxers, they need to be approached with empathy.
Unfortunately I've only so much patience.
