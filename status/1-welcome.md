Welcome, and hello. I'm Will Beason, that guy on the [about page](http://willbeason.wordpress.com/about/).

I need a place for my thoughts. I think a lot of things and like to write them down. Turns out, Facebook is not the ideal medium for discussing how [entropic gravity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropic_gravity) would make a cool hard scifi story, that [causal entropic forces](http://www.alexwg.org/publications/PhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf) can simulate intelligence, or what [the book I just read](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/35155451?shelf=read) made me think. Sometimes I make art with math and want to talk about how I made it. (Hint: header image)

Besides a mishmash of physics, mathematics, and computer science, I find a lot of other things interesting. Information is cool, and I like studying how it comes together to make systems. I think of myself as a [cyberneticist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics).

Maybe you'll find this interesting.
